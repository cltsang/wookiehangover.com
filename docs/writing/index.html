But let’s not chalk it up to laziness right away. Once I start seeing a particular pattern that’s useful for solving problems, well, as they (I) say, I’ve found my hammer, and everything becomes a nail.<sup><a href="#picking-up-the-pieces-01">1</a></sup></p> <p><strong>Helpful Metaphors</strong></p> <p>Travel metaphors are always useful, bringing in words like eyeline, takeoff, and landing into conversations makes work feel more like a swashbuckling adventure than a boring slog through a checklist.</p> <p>Eggs rolling towards the edge of a table is a particularly good image I’ve borrowed from Matt Work. It’s so damn useful when you need show how to deal with decision overload. “There are a dozen eggs rolling toward the edge of the table. You can only catch one.”</p> <p>It’s an argument against micromanagement and interventionism, while offering practical advice for most types of people wrangling problems.</p> <p><span class="f1 tc dib w-100">🍳</span></p> <p><strong>Unhelpful Metaphors</strong></p> <p>Have you ever found yourself saying the back half of a sentence in which you’ve been using an obtuse or random metaphor to summarize a situation, and you realize that your captive audience is making a face because you are in the middle of a cognitive leap so bizarre it would make an anti-comedian blush? Me too.</p> <p>I call that an “unhelpful metaphor.” Even if it does make sense without being a stretch, if it makes the poor audience question the sanity of the speaker it’s safe to say it should probably be left out.</p> <p><strong>Finding balance</strong></p> <p>Usually when I start employing these colorful turns of phrase it’s because I’m trending to frame a concept, and I’m using roughly hewn idioms in an imprecise language to do it. Like how a charcoal rubbing brings out the detail hidden to the naked eye, an applicable metaphor, however weird, can help drawn out a details that might not be readily apparent.</p> <p>So these days I just say it, whether or not it’s a weird comparison. I’m lending my point of view, and in a subjective world, the sooner you understand someone’s perspective, the sooner you’l be able to establish empathy.</p> <aside> <ol> <li id="picking-up-the-pieces-01">Ok. Let’s try and get through the rest this without over-packing every sentence with parenthetical asides (you’re not Faulkner, after all.)</li> </ol> </aside> <footer class="mv2"> <time>Last updated on <small><code class="pa1 bg-near-white mid-gray">Tue Sep 13 2016 19:40:34 GMT-0700 (PDT)</code></small></time> <nav class="mv2 mv0-ns fr-ns"> <a class="mr1" href="/writing/picking-up-the-pieces.html">Link</a> <a class="mr1" href="https://github.com/wookiehangover/wookiehangover.com/edit/master/writing/picking-up-the-pieces.md">Edit</a> <a class="mr1" href="https://github.com/wookiehangover/wookiehangover.com/commits/master/writing/picking-up-the-pieces.md">History</a> </nav> </footer> </article> <article id="making-things-for-fun"> <h2 id="making-things-for-fun">Making things for fun</h2> <p>This is not a blog—it’s a fun side-project done over a couple weekends. It’s not a blog because it’s not using any blogging software, per se, just some elbow grease and <a href="https://github.com/wookiehangover/wookiehangover.com/tree/master/build">a few scripts</a> that I’ve managed to string together into a mostly-working state.</p> <p>Simple products are fashionable these days, especially when it comes to media consumption. Even I’ve been known to write a Medium post every now and again, but I didn’t set out to build this as a monument to simplicity. This isn’t that type of place and I’m not that type of fella.</p> <p>This is just a barely functioning, loosely coherent website with weird cursor effects<sup><a href="#making-things-for-fun_footnote-01">1</a></sup> (unless I’ve gotten bored and removed them) and footnotes<sup><a href="#making-things-for-fun_footnote-02">2</a></sup> (I probably haven’t removed these.)</p> <blockquote> <p>So why go through all the trouble to build this in the first place? Why not just use Medium?</p> </blockquote> <p>Isn’t this what all developers inevitably do anyway? Build some crappy knock-off of good software because they’re ego is too big to use anything that’s not been graced to have sprung unbidden from their god-like cheeto-covered fingertips? Yes, let’s all create something second rate instead of using something off-the-shelf in order to scratch the proverbial itch? Why, yes. Yes, it’s probably something like that then.</p> <p>The question might as well then become, “why build anything at all?”</p> <p>I made this because it was fun. It was more fun figuring out how to <a href="https://github.com/remy/inliner">easily inline all the assets</a> and <a href="https://github.com/giakki/uncss">strip out unused css</a> on this page than it would have been to set up Wordpress again. The first time I ever set up Wordpress in 2008 was a magical and transcendent experience, so why am I so quick to shun it now? Wordpress is great software and I can’t make anything that comes close to it in a weekend.</p> <blockquote> <p>Doing something from scratch, even if it’s not polished, doesn’t deny or invalidate what you’ve done in the past.</p> </blockquote> <p>For a long time I refused to do any writing on my website because I felt like I didn’t have the time. I was afraid that anything I wrote would be bad and then I’d be committed to it forever, comma splices and all. Paranoia that I would look back on it later with utter embarrassment kept me from committing to much writing since I killed my <a href="http://samuelbreed.blogspot.com/">first blog</a> in 2008. What I guess I means is I’m over that now? <a href="https://www.jwz.org/doc/worse-is-better.html">Worse is better</a> after all, so why not let the shitposts start flowing!</p> <p>In keeping with that spirit, I’ve shoddily rebuild Jekyll so that I can have reasonable writing experience for myself, which means markdown and not much else to fuss over. I’m unburdened by the need for SEO or any other unspeakable non-sense, but I care about mobile web and I care about pagespeed so I’ve gone and done the aforementioned asset inlining, which I think has come out quite nicely.</p> <p>Go out and make something, even if it’s a shoddy facsimile of something else.</p> <p>(And, yes, I do plan on building an HTML guest book some day. But for now a link to twitter will have to suffice ;)</p> <aside> <ol> <li id="making-things-for-fun_footnote-01"> The custom cursors (provided they’re still here, if not, I’ll include a gif) were a fun idea I gleaned from <a href="https://twitter.com/kwuchu">@kwuchu</a> tweeting about redesigning his portfolio site, which featured a similarly cropped picture of him. Since I already had the avatar of my face cropped out, I threw it on the header to see how it would look. It was static and unmoving and no fun whatsoever. I don’t know how I stumbled into the custom cursor CSS, but I definitely used <a href="https://davidwalsh.name/css-custom-cursor">David Walsh’s blog post</a> to see it in action and grok how it should work. Then <a href="https://twitter.com/ohhoe">@ohhoe</a> asked my to make sparkle trails and I couldn’t say “no” to that. </li> <li id="making-things-for-fun_footnote-02"> Who doesn’t love a good footnote?

Recommended by both my wife and best friend, I was pleased to so quickly become completely immersed in it. Gaiman creates moody settings that feel rich without going into Stephen King–levels of hyper-detail.</p> <p>I did have a funny note about Laura, though.

Jemisin</del></summary> <p>I bought this based on an enthusiastic employee recommendation placard at Borderlands Books in San Francisco but set it down less than a quarter of the way into it for reasons I can no longer recall. I decided to pick it up again this year and loved it.</p> <p>Jemisin is a creator of vivid universes: they pull you into their orbit until they envelop you completely, at which point you’ll find yourself thumbing back to previous chapters scanning for the precious and minute x devices that do so well to establish an <em>exact</em> tone and setting. There’s just enough narrative white space to contrast with the hyper-detailed emotional awareness of the characters and settings so that the story is framed with elaborate societal backstory that has clear eye-line to the sequel(s).
