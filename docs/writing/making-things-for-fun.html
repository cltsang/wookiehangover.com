It&apos;s not a blog because it&apos;s not using any blogging software, per se, just some elbow grease and <a href="https://github.com/wookiehangover/wookiehangover.com/tree/master/build">a few scripts</a> that I&apos;ve managed to string together into a mostly-working state.</p> <p>Simple products are fashionable these days, especially when it comes to media consumption. Even I&apos;ve been known to write a Medium post every now and again, but I didn&apos;t set out to build this as a monument to simplicity. This isn&apos;t that type of place and I&apos;m not that type of fella.</p> <p>This is just a barely functioning, loosely coherent website with weird cursor effects<sup><a href="#making-things-for-fun_footnote-01">1</a></sup> (unless I&apos;ve gotten bored and removed them) and footnotes<sup><a href="#making-things-for-fun_footnote-02">2</a></sup> (I probably haven&apos;t removed these.)</p> <p>So why go through all the trouble to build this in the first place?</p> <p>Isn&apos;t this what all developers inevitably do anyway? Build some crappy knock-off of good software because they&apos;re ego is too big to use anything that&apos;s not been graced to have sprung unbidden from their god-like cheeto-covered fingertips? Yes, let&apos;s all create something second rate instead of using something off-the-shelf in order to scratch the proverbial itch? Why, yes. Yes, it&apos;s probably something like that.</p> <p>The question might as well then become, &quot;why build anything at all?&quot;</p> <p>I made this because it was fun. It was more fun figuring out how to <a href="https://github.com/remy/inliner">easily inline all the assets</a> and <a href="https://github.com/giakki/uncss">strip out unused css</a> on this page than it would have been to set up Wordpress again. The first time I ever set up Wordpress in 2008 was a magical and transcendent experience, so why am I so quick to shun it now? Wordpress is great software and I can&apos;t make anything that comes close to it in a weekend.</p> <p><em>Doing something from scratch, even if it&apos;s not polished, doesn&apos;t deny or invalidate what you&apos;ve done in the past.</em></p> <p>For a long time I refused to do any writing on my website because I felt like I didn&apos;t have the time. I was afraid that anything I wrote would be bad and then I&apos;d be committed to it forever, comma splices and all. Paranoia that I would look back on it later with utter embarrassment kept me from committing to much writing since I killed my <a href="http://samuelbreed.blogspot.com/">first blog</a> in 2008. What I guess I means is I&apos;m over that now? <a href="https://www.jwz.org/doc/worse-is-better.html">Worse is better</a> after all, so why not let the shitposts start flowing!</p> <p>In keeping with that spirit, I&apos;ve shoddily rebuild Jekyll so that I can have reasonable writing experience for myself, which means markdown and not much else to fuss over. I&apos;m unburdened by the need for SEO or any other unspeakable non-sense, but I care about mobile web and I care about pagespeed so I&apos;ve gone and done the aforementioned asset inlining, which I think has come out quite nicely.</p> <p>Go out and make something, even if it&apos;s a shoddy facsimile of something else.</p> <p>(And, yes, I do plan on building an HTML guest book some day. But for now a link to twitter will have to suffice ;)</p> <footer> <ol> <li id="making-things-for-fun_footnote-01"> The custom cursors (provided they&apos;re still here, if not, I&apos;ll include a gif) were a fun idea I gleaned from <a href="https://twitter.com/kwuchu">@kwuchu</a> tweeting about redesigning his portfolio site, which featured a similarly cropped picture of him. Since I already had the avatar of my face cropped out, I threw it on the header to see how it would look. It was static and unmoving and no fun whatsoever. I don&apos;t know how I stumbled into the custom cursor CSS, but I definitely used <a href="https://davidwalsh.name/css-custom-cursor">David Walsh&apos;s blog post</a> to see it in action and grok how it should work. Then <a href="https://twitter.com/ohhoe">@ohhoe</a> asked my to make sparkle trails and I couldn&apos;t say &quot;no&quot; to that. </li> <li id="making-things-for-fun_footnote-02"> Who doesn&apos;t love a good footnote?
