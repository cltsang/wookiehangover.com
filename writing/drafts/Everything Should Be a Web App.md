# Everything Should Be a Web App

I guess they’ll call the internet in 2016 “Web 4.0” or something someday. Not like that means much of anything anyways, since it’s such a loose distinction.

I wonder what that will mean when we look back on it?

I remember “Web 2.0” was already a tired expression when I first started working in tech. Still, I knew what it meant. Maybe it was just those rounded corners and image overlay badges, or things like Blogger and Digg and MySpace and Facebook when you needed a college email and it demanded you precede it’s name with a definite article. When the hangover from the first tech bubble started wearing off. When the so-called incubators like Y-Combinator and TechStars were established and the now-weathered veterans-cum-V.C’s from before the bubble started spouting their strategies to “maximize optionality.”

When I was starting out I felt like I was already behind and trying to catchup.

## Fire in the Valley

I often think about what I missed by not being “in tech” (or rather “in the Bay Area”) in those days. I graduated high school in 2004, meaning that if I had my shit together I could have gotten the fuck out of Tampa and high-tailed it to the west coast just in time to be on the ground floor to something cool.

Instead I went to college and said “fuck computers.”

I knew, however, I was still “good” with computers, whatever that means, I just lacked the vision and drive to understand that I could effectively hustle my way into tech if I wanted to. I didn’t manage to _really_ do that until 2009, after really _deciding_ to at the end of 2008. I read the New Yorker piece about Sam Altman and couldn’t help but feel the hot sting of envy reading about him at Stanford in 2005. Right place at the right time, I guess. Like Steve at the Homebrew Computing Club. I can’t read about that and not wish for that type of kismet in my life.

## Run. Then Run Faster.

When I was at Quick Left I would often describe my situation as a rat running on a wheel: you’re only ever judged by how fast you ran last month. The only measure of progress is if you’re running faster than you did the month before.

## My dumb luck focused into sharp relief

Now that I’m a little bit older, I feel less like I missed out on anything. But I have learned that luck can’t be manufactured a priori, but that it’s only ever the by-product of effort, perseverance, and good timing. It’s either that, or it’s completely dumb. Some people just manage to catch the bus and others don’t.

I’ve been exceptionally lucky a number of times:

1. Not dying of when meningitis I was 11
2. Meeting my wife
3. Meeting Dan Storch on Twitter, who immediately introduced me to Colin, who took a chance on an unknown kid and hired me at Quick Left
4. Meeting Joe Stump on Twitter, and then trying to aggressively grow Quick Left and failing, which finally got me to San Francisco

Numbers 1 & 2 are what I would classify as “dumb luck.” My presence in these events is entirely circumstantial, but swap someone else into my position and you’ll likely get different results, but there are no guarantees either way since the statistical odds weigh heavily against you.

Now, but 3 & 4 are the sweeter fruit indeed, since these are what I would deem “manufactured” despite suffering from the similarly unfavorable odds as the others. I say this because these were triggered by deliberate action on my part—so even if I was being dumb, I was at least doing so intentionally.

## What am I going to build for 2017

I’ve been obsessed with Zeit this year. Everything they do seems to fit a pain point I’ve had precisely. Seriously, like with laser-guided accuracy. Today while I was trying out their latest project, Next.js, I happened upon the the thought, “they’re the most 2016 startup of 2016.”

I meant that because of the things they’ve been releasing — single command microservice deploys powered by docker, smart global DNS, a universal rendering JS framework — these ideas have been so fitting with their company name: they’re capturing the zeitgeist more effectively than anyone else.
