      <summary>_The Illuminatus! Trilogy_ — Robert Shea and Robert Anton Wilson</summary>
      <p>I've read this before and I absolutely love it. Pure sci-fi zanyness with enough acid trips, talking dolphins, and fractal structure make it prime re-reading material, allowing for the slow jokes to play out with more more anticipation and certainly with more perspective to better take in the instant shifts betweens characters and timelines.</p>

      <summary>~~_Influx_ — Daniel Suarez~~<sup>&dagger;</sup></summary>
      <p>Yet another Daniel Suarez tech thriller that I liked. I listened to this one instead of reading it, and as if this is any sort of compliment, but it made doing the dishes and assembling IKEA furniture thoroughly enjoyable.</p>

      <summary>~~_American Gods_ – Neil Gaiman~~</summary>
      <p>Finally, finally got around to reading this after letting it languish on my Kindle for several years. Recommended by both my wife and best friend, I was pleased to so quickly become completely immersed in it. Gaiman creates moody settings that feel rich without going into Stephen King–levels of hyper-detail.</p>

      <p>I did have a funny note about Laura, though. Is it just me does she mostly serve as a corpse-ified version a manic pixie dreamgirl?</p>

       <summary>~~_The Killing Moon_ – N.K. Jemisin~~</summary>
       <p>I bought this based on an enthusiastic employee recommendation placard at Borderlands Books in San Francisco but set it down less than a quarter of the way into it for reasons I can no longer recall. I decided to pick it up again this year and loved it.</p>

       <p>Jemisin is a creator of vivid universes: they pull you into their orbit until they envelop you completely, at which point you'll find yourself thumbing back to previous chapters scanning for the precious and minute x devices that do so well to establish an _exact_ tone and setting. There's just enough narrative white space to contrast with the hyper-detailed emotional awareness of the characters and settings so that the story is framed with elaborate societal backstory that has clear eye-line to the sequel(s). Great sci-fi recommendation.</p>

       <p>Update: also going back and listening to this now on on Audible</p>

        <summary>~~_Fire in the Valley_ – Michael Swaine and Paul Freiberger~~</summary>
        <p>I often think about what I missed by not being “in tech” (or rather “in the Bay Area”) in those days. I graduated high school in 2004, meaning that if I had my shit together I could have gotten the fuck out of Tampa and high-tailed it to the west coast just in time to be on the ground floor to something cool.</p>

        <p>Instead I went to college and said “fuck computers."</p>

        <p>I knew, however, I was still “good” with computers, whatever that means, I just lacked the vision and drive to understand that I could effectively hustle my way into tech if I wanted to. I didn’t manage to _really_ do that until 2009, after really _deciding_ to at the end of 2008. I read the New Yorker piece about Sam Altman and couldn’t help but feel the hot sting of envy reading about him at Stanford in 2005. Right place at the right time, I guess. Like Steve at the Homebrew Computing Club. I can’t read about that and not wish for that type of kismet in my life.</p>
