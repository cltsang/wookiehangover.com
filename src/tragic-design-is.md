## Tragic Design is...

When an app lets you accidentally enter a zip code instead of a full address and still completes your order. Optimizing for click-throughs, I guess?

<div class="w-100 mb2 fr-ns tc">
  <a href="/img/tragic-01.png"><img src="../img/tragic-01.png" alt="uber eats it" /></a><br/>
  <small><i>huh?</i></small>
</div>

This was too boring for a tweet and now I want to find more examples.
