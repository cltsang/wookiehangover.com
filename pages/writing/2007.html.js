# 2007

In January of 2007 I was 20 years old.

I had no job.

I couldn't pay for college and simultaneously failed out.

Then I got a dui.

Then I wrecked my car.

With no license. And no insurance. And in an accident with another car. I had to beg my brother to loan me money to fix the other person's car. Meanwhile my car sat unmoving and wrecked, collecting parking tickets until I sold it as-is for next to nothing.

When I did get a job, it only paid $9 an hour. For 32 hours a week. Technically part time.

I didn't have health insurance. I watched Prince perform the Super Bowl halftime show in the ER waiting room. I had a fever for 3 days and my tonsils were so swollen I could hardly breathe.

It would be 3 years before I would pay the bill for the ER visit that night, which would tarnish my credit score for years afterwards.

The $12,000 tuition that I owed the school was sent to collections, which I ignored for 4 years and 20% annual interest in late fees.

My girlfriend and I got good at grocery store math pretty quick, because having to put stuff back after it was rung up was mortifying. A year earlier I had been living off a trust fund. They payments stopped that winter.

2007 was the worst year of my life.

But it was also one of the best.

2007 was the year I moved in with my then-girlfriend (and now-wife.)

I got promoted to assistant manager at the retail job. My pay was raised to $11 dollars and hour, and I would get 36 hours a week on the schedule. That extra $108 a week was a lot of money. It meant less math at the grocery store.

My wife and I adopted a beat up little shelter dog that winter and named him Jack. He's still here, but now he's old and cranky after 10 years of being doted on and loved unconditionally.

2007 was the year I started riding a bike (for transportation, then for fun) and picked up skateboarding again (for fun, then for transportation.)

2007 was the year I started taking any job on any film shoot I could find. Most of them were unpaid, on the hope of paid gigs in the future.

And 2007 was the year I started to code.

I used the money from selling the car to buy a white plastic MacBook. My PowerBook from college had finally died that fall. I remember tracking the shipment from the pc in the back office at work on my break, and then racing home on my bike during my lunch so the package wouldn't get stolen from my doorstep.

> It was the first computer I would get paid to write code on.

I was so excited to get that computer. I used it to climb out of debt and into a career I love. In 2007 I would write my first website and re-discover the love of building stuff on the internet that I had honed a decade earlier on Geocities and Tripod and Angelfire (and later, MySpace profiles.)

That year I listened to MGMT, Peter, Bjorn and John, and Kanye West that year. I can remember riding my bike to those albums as fall in Boulder started to turn cold.

Across town, TechStars would host its first class. A year later one of those companies would be acquired AOL for seven figures. I'd find out about this well after it happened, at a tech meetup where the founder, who was only a year or two older than me, ended his presentation by throwing $500 in singles into the air.

That guy is still around and I still hate him for doing that. It made me feel so worthless. I didn't have a job in tech yet, despite wanting one, and was only slightly better off than I had been a year earlier. And here comes some jerkoff that was first given money for a fucking _idea_ and then fucking _sold_ that idea for even more money!

A year earlier I was excited to get a raise for less money than he just threw on the ground.

That night fueled my resolve to work as hard as I could to never feel that way again. Poor and put out. An outsider looking in. And it gave me a model of something I never wanted to do.

I saw a tweet from that guy today. It got me thinking about that night and the terribly un-fun year before it. The funny thing is that he doesn't even know me. But he pissed me off so badly a decade ago that I'm still stewing about it now.

But that night wasn't all bad.

That was also the night I would meet Ingrid, who would eventually be my co-founder at Quick Left. But we wouldn't know that for another year. We just hung out and talked about bikes and software.

And maybe I owe something to the guy who threw the money after all. After that I started hustling for web design jobs on craigslist and less than a year later I would have a full time job. That job turned into Quick Left, a company that I would become a founder of and lead for 6 years.

> Good things and bad things can happen in startlingly close proximity.

2007 was a bad year, but I wouldn't trade any of the lessons it taught me.
